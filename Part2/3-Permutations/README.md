# Permutations

This program generates all permutations of a given string using Heap's algorithm.

## Getting Started

This implementation is built in Perl 5. To run the script, an equivalent version of Perl must be installed.

### Running the Script

To run the script from a terminal window, enter the command `perl permutations.pl` followed by the string for which all permutations should be generated. An example, along with its output, is found below.

**Example**

```
perl permutations.pl abc

abc
bac
cab
acb
bca
cba
```
