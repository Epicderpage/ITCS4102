# File I/O

This program reads a text file, then creates another text file containing only the number of words found in the input text file.

## Getting Started

This implementation is built in Perl 5. To run the script, an equivalent version of Perl must be installed.

### Running the Script

To run the script from a terminal window, enter the command `perl countWords.pl` followed by the name of the text file. An example text file is included, named `test.txt`. An example, along with its output, is found below.

**Example**

```
perl countWords.pl test.txt

The created file is out_test.txt, and it contains:
 13
```
