# Check Balanced Paretheses

Given a string of opening and closing parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}, this program determins whether it is balanced. This assumes that the string does not contain any other characters.

## Getting Started

This implementation is built in Perl 5. To run the game, an equivalent version of Perl must be installed.

### Running the Script

To run the script from a terminal window, enter the command `perl balanced.pl` followed by the string of parenthetic characters (do not separate characters by spaces). Examples, along with their output, are shown below.

```
perl balanced.pl {}([])
Balanced!

perl balanced.pl ({[}])
Unbalanced
```
